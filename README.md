## Sample Experiment Results

#### Distance between two objects in tha same image

<img src="experiment/features.png" width='333' height='266' align="middle"><img src="experiment/books_distance.png" width='355' height='266' align="middle">  

:straight_ruler: Result: approximately 592px.

#### Distance between the same object in different scenes

<img src="experiment/scene.png" width='505' height='207' align="middle"><img src="experiment/book_distance_scene.png" width='355' height='266' align="middle">  

:straight_ruler: Result: approximately 471px.
